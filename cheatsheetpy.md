# Python Cheatsheet 🐍💻

## 1. Using `end` to control the end of a line in `print()`
```python
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("world")
# Output:
# Hello world
```

## 2. Using `sep` to separate values in `print()`
Remember: Keyword arguments should be passed **after** any required positional arguments.
```python
print("Python", "is", "awesome", sep=" 🔥 ")
# Output:
# Python 🔥 is 🔥 awesome
```

## 3. Using `\n` to separate values in `print()`
```python
print("My\nname\nis\nBond.", end=" ")
print("James Bond.")
# Output:
# My
# name
# is
# Bond. James Bond.
```
## 4. SECTION 2 SUMMARY

A variable is a named location reserved to store values in the memory. A variable is created or initialized automatically when you assign a value to it for the first time. 

Each variable must have a unique name ‒ an identifier. A legal identifier name must be a non-empty sequence of characters, must begin with the underscore (`_`), or a letter, and it cannot be a Python keyword. The first character may be followed by underscores, letters, and digits. Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive.

Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means you do not need to declare variables in it. (2.1.4.3) To assign values to variables, you can use a simple assignment operator in the form of the equal (`=`) sign, i.e., `var = 1`.

You can also use compound assignment operators (shortcut operators) to modify values assigned to variables, for example: `var += 1`, or `var /= 5 * 2`.

You can assign new values to already existing variables using the assignment operator or one of the compound operators, for example:

| Variable | Python Real | Quiz Expected | Why |
|:---------|:------------|:--------------|:----|
| `my_var` | ✅ Legal | ✅ Legal | Correct. |
| `m` | ✅ Legal | ✅ Legal | Correct. |
| `101` | ❌ Illegal | ❌ Illegal | Cannot start with a number. |
| `averylongVariablename` | ✅ Legal | ✅ Legal | No problem, long names are allowed. |
| `m101` | ✅ Legal | ✅ Legal | Starts with a letter, fine. |
| `m 101` | ❌ Illegal | ❌ Illegal | Contains a space. |
| `Del` | ✅ Legal | ✅ Legal | Adding a number makes it fine. |
| `del1` | ✅ Legal | ❌ Illegal | Technically allowed in Python, but the quiz marks it illegal because it resembles the reserved word `del`. |

## 5. input() Function 

`input()` is a built-in function used to get input from the user.

```python
print("Tell me anything...")
anything = input()
print("Hmm...", anything, "... Really?")
# Output:
#Tell me anything...
#hello
#Hmm... hello ... Really?
```
## 6. Temporary Variables
The `hypo` variable temporarily stores a calculated value between two lines of code.

- Used to hold intermediate results.
- Improves code readability.

## 7.`while` Loop in Python

The `while` loop repeats a block of code **as long as a given condition is `True`**.

### Syntax:
```python
while condition:
    # code block
```

## 8. `counter` variable
A `counter` is often used to:
-Keep track of iterations
-Control loop execution
-Store counts of events or items

## 9.  Using `break`
se sale del loop
```python
print("The break instruction:")
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print("Inside the loop.", i)
print("Outside the loop.")
```
## 9.  Using `continue`
se lo salta basicamente
```python
print("\nThe continue instruction:")
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print("Inside the loop.", i)
print("Outside the loop.")

```
## 10.  Using `continue`
`del` is a Python statement used to delete variables, list elements, or dictionary keys from memory.

## 11.  Functions vs. Methods
A function is a block of code that does something. It’s not connected to any specific data. It just takes input, does something, and gives you a result.

A method is like a function, but it's part of an object (like a string or list). It can work on that object and even change it.

In short:
👉 A function stands alone.
👉 A method belongs to something (like a string, list, etc.).

## 12. 🧠 Understanding `def` in Python

In Python, `def` is a **keyword** used to define a function.

### 🔹 What is a function?

A function is a block of code that has a **name** and can be **called** whenever you need it. Functions help you:

- Organize your code
- Avoid repeating things
- Make code easier to read and maintain

---

### 📌 Basic function structure:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
```

## 13. Python Tuples – Summary

### 🔹 What is a tuple?

A tuple is an **ordered**, **immutable** collection in Python. It's like a list, but you **can't change** its values once created.

---

### ✅ Key Features

- Immutable (can’t be modified)
- Ordered and indexed
- Allows duplicates
- More memory-efficient than lists

---

### 🛠️ Creating Tuples
Tuple example – ordered and immutable

```python
student = ("Bro", 21, "male")
```
Methods
```python
print(student.count("Bro"))   # Output: 1
print(student.index("male"))  # Output: 2
```
Loop through tuple
```python
for x in student:
    print(x)
```
Membership check
```python
if "Bro" in student:
    print("Bro is here!")
```
